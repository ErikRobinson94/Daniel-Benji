                    <h1>Common Los Angeles Car Accident Injuries</h1>
                    <p>The severity of your car accident injuries ultimately determines your claim’s value. Be sure to attend follow-up treatment and record any medical bills, treatment documents, and insurance info.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the most common injuries we see after auto collisions:</p>
                    <li><a href=""> Head and Brain Injuries</a> — This involves concussions, skull fractures, or other traumatic brain inuries</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Neck and Back Injuries</a> — This includes Whiplash, herniated or bulging discs, or spinal injuries. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Burn Injuries</a> — Whether minor or fatal, burns might leave cause serious disfigurement and require skin grafts. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Soft Tissue Injuries</a> — Some accidents cause ligaments or muscles to tear causing lasting damage.</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Broken Bones</a> — These injuries require surgery and a long recovery period. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Spinal Injuries</a>- These are devastating injuries that could alter someone’s life entirely and may result in permanent wheelchair use due to a loss of movement in the lower extremities.</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Knee Injuries</a> — The knee is one of the body’s biggest joints. Car crashes can damage them, causing anything from discomfort to lifelong impacts. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> PTSD</a>— Not all injuries are visible. Car crashes can cause post-traumatic stress disorder, which can have long-term effects on a victim’s life. The at-fault driver can be held accountable for PTSD-related expenses.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Compensation for Damages & Losses in Car Accident Cases</h1>
                <p>When someone else is liable for your injuries, you have the right to pursue compensation. Your final settlement should consider all the ways your life was affected by your accident, including both monetary and non-monetary damages.</p>
                <p>Calculating monetary damages is pretty straightforward and easily proven with proper documentation. These damages include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href=""> Lost Wages</a></li>
                    <li><a href=""> Diminshed earning capacity</a></li>
                    <li> Childcare expenses</li>
                    <li>House hold maintenance fees</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Medical expenses</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="">Non-economic damages</a> are not as easy to value, but should be considered, nonethe less. These damags include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss consortium</li>
                    <li>Diminished quality of life</li>
                    <li>Diminished quality of life</li>
                    <li><a href="">Physical pain and suffering</a></li>
                    <li>Reputational damage</li>
                    <li><a href="">Disfigurement and scarring</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href=""> Punitive damages</a> are also available in car accident cases, but only in extreme situations. Reckless and drunk driving are common examples.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="pagesRightColumnCar">
                    <p>Most car accident cases are based on negligence. This means that another driver or some other party acted unreasonably or failed to act and caused you else harm.</p>
                    <h1>Car Accident Evidence & Documentation</h1>
                    <p>It may seem obvious who’s at fault in your car accident. However, you must prove that someone was speeding, distracted, or intoxicated to have a successful claim.</p>
                    <p>The burden of proof for a civil lawsuit is based on a preponderance of the evidence, which means that enough evidence exists to prove that the other party is more likely than not to have caused your injuries. Photos, eyewitness testimonies, and other forms of evidence could be used to prove fault.</p>
                   
                    <h1>Liability & Fault in a Los Angeles Car Accident</h1>
                    <p>Your injuries alone aren’t enough to prove liability. To determine liability, you must establish the four elements of negligence. Someone must owe you a duty of care, fail to uphold that duty, and cause your damages, which require monetary compensation.</p>
                    <p>Los Angeles is an at-fault state for liability in a car accident. In most cases, you will file a third-party claim with the responsible driver’s insurance company or their employer if they were working at the time.</p>
                    <p>However, insurers aren’t likely to give you the compensation you need to recover. That’s why you need car insurance lawyer to look out for your best interests.</p>
