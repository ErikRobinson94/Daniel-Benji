                <h1>Common Causes of Motorcycle Accidents</h1>
                <p>Many motorcycle accidents can be traced back to one specific mistake or error. Some of the most common causes include driver error, unsafe lane changes, speeding, and impaired driving. It can also be dangerous to motorcycle riders when a car door is opened in the path of a bike. Sudden stops by other vehicles and failure to yield also pose problems to bikers. No matter the cause, we’ll help prove liability in your case.</p>
                <h1>Common Motorcycle Accident Injuries</h1>
                <p>Accident victims are at risk of serious injuries when they are involved in a crash. Some of the most commonly reported motorcycle injuries include broken bones, burns, permanent nerve damage, facial injuries, and spinal cord damage. Road rash is unique to motorcycle accidents and can lead to infection, persistent skin irritation, and disfigurement.</p>

                <h1>Insurance Issues</h1>
                <p>The State of California shares a widespread bias against bikers which often leads to an extraordinarily low settlement offer from the insurance company. In addition, some other common insurance issues that you may face are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The at-fault driver is uninsured or underinsured, which may require you to use your underinsured/uninsured motorist benefits</li>
                    <li> Medical expenses exceed the at-fault driver’s liability coverage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We’re here to navigate you through these issues and negotiate a settlement that works in your favor – not the insurance companies.</p>
