                <h1>Hit by a Car on Your Bike? Our Bike Accident Lawyers Can Help</h1>
                <p>If you got hurt or lost a loved one in a bicycle crash, call a Los Angeles bicycle accident lawyer as soon as possible.

But when you’ve been hurt, our bike accident attorneys go after the maximum compensation possible for your injuries.</p>

                <h1> Los Angeles Bicycle Laws</h1>
                <p>Cyclists in California are required to follow the same traffic laws as vehicles. They ride in the same direction as traffic and obey traffic signs and stoplights. They can ride two abreast and should keep as close to the right of the lane as possible. There are some differences, though. In some places, bikes can be on the side or in a crosswalk. At these times, bike riders have to obey pedestrian signs and signals.</p>
                <p>Bicyclists on sidewalks and crosswalks must yield the right of way to pedestrians. Bike riders should slow down and let people go first. If a biker needs to pass a pedestrian, they should slow down and give an audible signal – either shout out or use a bell.</p>
    
                <h2>All bicycles must have certain safety equipment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Front light visible for atleast 500 ft (if riding at night)</li>
                    <li>Clear front reflector</li>
                    <li>Rear red reflector visible between 100 and 600 ft</li>
                    <li>Wheel-mounted side reflectors</li>
                    <li>Reflector pedals</li>
                    <li>brakes</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Types of Bicycle Accidents</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bicycle and Vehicle Accidents</strong>: Some of the most serious injuries and deaths happen in a collision involving a cyclist and car or truck. If you were struck by a vehicle, and the driver was at fault, call a lawyer today.</li>
                    <li><strong>Car Door Accidents</strong>: Far too many drivers and passengers fail to pay attention to cyclists. When your’re riding your bike, a door might be opened in your path. Unable to avoid it, you could get hurt in a serious collision.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Bicycle Accidents</strong>: Though it’s less common, multiple cyclists can collide and sustain serious injuries. If you believe another cyclist is at fault for the crash, talk with a lawyer about how to pursue compensation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bicycle and Pedestrian Accidents</strong>: Bicycle riders and people on foot often compete for space, which leads to collisions. When you’re hurt in a bike-pedestrian accident, talk with us about proving who was responsible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Children’s Bicycle Accidents</strong>: Riding bikes is a beloved childhood pastime. Unfortunately, children are at risk of being hit by cars in the street, at intersections, and in driveways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defective Bicycle Accidents</strong>: Some people are casual bike riders, while others are avid enthusiasts. Serious cyclists often ride expensive bikes, and they expect them to be well-designed and manufactured. A design or manufacturing defect could lead to an accident.</li>
                    <li><strong>Electric Bicycle (E-Bike) Accidents</strong>: E-bikes have become popular for people who want to travel long distances or more easily conquer hills. But electric bikes come with their own potential problems, including defects and malfunctioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bicycle and CTA Accident</strong>: Cyclists in Los Angeles might be involved in an accident with a CTA bus or the L in one of the few places its street-level grade.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Who Is At Fault for a Bike Crash?</h1>
                <p>Who is at fault depends on each specific situation. Cyclists can be at fault for serious crashes, though they often aren’t. Many bicycle accidents are caused by negligent motorists who aren’t looking out for bikes, or by pedestrians who step into bike lanes without looking.</p>
                <p>When you’re injured in an accident involving a bicycle rider, talk with an experienced personal injury attorney about investigating. A thorough review of the evidence can determine who was responsible, or if two or more people share fault.</p>
                <p>In California, fault is determined based on the proportion of fault. For example, both a cyclist and a pedestrian might have contributed to a crash. But which person was more at fault? Anyone who is less than 50% responsible can demand compensation for their injuries. People who are 51% or more at fault are responsible for paying for other people’s injuries and can’t recover compensation for their own.</p>
                <h1>Common Bicycle Accident Injuries</h1>
                <p><strong>Cyclists and pedestrians involved in bike accidents often suffer:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Concussions and more serious Traumatic Brain Injuries</li>
                    <li>Back Injuries</li>

                <h1>Compensation for Bike Crash Injuries</h1>
                <p>After being injured in a bicycle accident that someone else caused, you can demand compensation for your financial, physical, and emotional injuries.</p>

                    <li>Emotional distress</li>
                    <li>Disfigurement</li>
                    <li>Disability</li>
                    <li>Reduced future income</li>
                    <li>Lower quality of life</li>
                    <li>Loss of consortium</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>You Have Two Years to Bring a Claim</h1>
                <p>In Los Angeles, there’s a two-year statute of limitations. You have two years from the date of the bike crash to file a lawsuit against the at-fault party. But you shouldn’t wait that long to get started. It’s much better to talk with a lawyer as soon as possible. When you hire an attorney within days or weeks of the accident, evidence is more readily available. Witnesses’ memories are sharper. You can keep your paperwork and bills organized from the very beginning.</p>
