                <p>Sometimes, products we expect to be safe…aren’t. Many people every year are hurt by products whose design flaws, defects or inadequate warnings result in lasting injury. And it’s not right. A Benji products liability attorney can help identify which of the many parties involved are responsible. These cases are investigation-heavy, often requiring in-depth analysis and expert testimony. They are complex and time-consuming. They can be difficult to win because companies are quick to pour significant resources into avoiding responsibility for their negligence – and your injuries. </p>

                <h2>Settlement</h2>
                <p>If we are able to reach an agreement before trial, we have a settlement. Settlements should consider all past and future expenses – medical costs, wage loss, pain and suffering and the like and will come in one lump sum in exchange for your dismissal.</p>

                <h2>Personal Injury Jury Trial</h2>
                <p>If we aren’t able to negotiate a fair settlement, we go to trial. At trial, we’ll present your case, employing the evidence uncovered in the discovery phase and presenting any expert testimony. We often prefer juries to judges, because they’re usually more understanding of personal loss than a judge.</p>

                <h2>Appeal</h2>
                <p>What if the jury rules against you? If some kind of legal error was made by the defense or the court, we may choose to appeal. We will probably have to present additional evidence and legal arguments to the court to back up our thinking. If we’re successful, the court could reverse the previous order, or decide that another trial is necessary.</p>
