                <p>Car crash cases require a lot of evidence gathering. Police reports, debris fields, and eyewitness accounts require a special set of investigative skills that we’ve honed for over 20 years. Our injury attorneys know all the insurance companies. And they know we mean business. We know you’re hurting. When you call, you’ll always speak with a Benji Personal Injury Attorney, not an assistant. And there will never be a fee unless you win.</p>

                <p>Los Angeles is loaded with 18-wheelers. This is a port city and big trucks are as common as potholes. But as almost everyone knows, if a car gets into an altercation with a semi, the car always loses. We can change that if you go to court with our personal injury lawyers.</p>

And it’s not right. A Benji products liability attorney can help identify which of the many parties involved are responsible. These cases are investigation-heavy, often requiring in-depth analysis and expert testimony. They are complex and time-consuming. They can be difficult to win because companies are quick to pour significant resources into avoiding responsibility for their negligence – and your injuries. </p>
