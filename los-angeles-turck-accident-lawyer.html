                <h1>Truck Accident Attorneys to Kick-Start Your Recovery</h1>
                <p> Attempting to represent yourself is a mistake in a truck accident case. Immediately after an accident with a semi-truck, insurance companies send out what they refer to as ‘The Truck Accident Autopsy Team’ to carry out an extensive investigation, so they already have a head-start in the case. And they’re not there to uncover the truth – they are there to minimize their own financial liability. </p>

                    <p>Whether it was a semi-truck, an 18-wheeler, or some other large commercial truck vehicle, crashes occur for many reasons and often result in severe injuries. Sometimes establishing responsibility is obvious. Other times, it takes an investigation to determine if a truck driver was distracted, poorly trained by their employer, or negligently log their required hours of service.</p>

                    <p>The type of vehicle crash you suffer determines the injuries you suffer and their severity. Common types of crashes include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Truck vs car accidents</li>
                        <li>Rollovers occur when a truck driver loses control of the vehicle and it rolls onto its side</li>
                        <li><a href="">Jacknife accidents</a> accidents happen when the cab and trailer make a 90-degree angle, causing the truck to slide</li>
                        <li>Tire blowouts often cause a truck to swerve uncontrollably, putting drivers in all lanes at risk</li>
                        <li>Blindspot accidents typically happen when a trucker changes lanes and a vehicle is in the driver’s blind spot</li>
                        <li> <a href=""> Rear-end accidents</a>are common since truckers need much more time to come to a safe stop; rear-end trucking accidents usually cause much more damage than a rear-end motor vehicle accident involving passenger vehicles</li>
                        <li> <a href="">Underride crash</a> happen when a truck stops and a smaller car behind it gets stuck under the truck’s tractor-trailer</li>
                    </ul>   
                    <h1>Typical Injuries after Truck Accidents</h1>
                    <p>The severity of your injuries after a major truck wreck significantly impacts the value of your insurance claim and possible truck accident lawsuit. It’s important to keep up with medical treatment and document your recovery. This includes medical bills, treatment documents, and insurance info.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the most common injuries we see after auto collisions:</p>
                    <li><a href=""> Head and Brain Injuries</a> — This involves concussions, skull fractures, or other traumatic brain inuries</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Neck and Back Injuries</a> — This includes Whiplash, herniated or bulging discs, or spinal injuries. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Burn Injuries</a> — Whether minor or fatal, burns might leave cause serious disfigurement and require skin grafts. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Soft Tissue Injuries</a> — Some accidents cause ligaments or muscles to tear causing lasting damage.</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Broken Bones</a> — These injuries require surgery and a long recovery period. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> Spinal Injuries</a>- These are devastating injuries that could alter someone’s life entirely and may result in permanent wheelchair use due to a loss of movement in the lower extremities.</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Knee Injuries</a> — The knee is one of the body’s biggest joints. Car crashes can damage them, causing anything from discomfort to lifelong impacts. </li>
                    <li><a href=""> PTSD</a>— Not all injuries are visible. Car crashes can cause post-traumatic stress disorder, which can have long-term effects on a victim’s life. The at-fault driver can be held accountable for PTSD-related expenses.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Truck Accident Damages & Losses </h1>
                <p>When someone else is liable for your injuries, you have the right to pursue compensation. Your final settlement should consider all the ways your life was affected by your accident, including both monetary and non-monetary damages.</p>
                <p>Calculating monetary damages is pretty straightforward and easily proven with proper documentation. These damages include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href=""> Lost Wages</a></li>
                    <li><a href=""> Diminshed earning capacity</a></li>
                    <li> Childcare expenses</li>
                    <li>House hold maintenance fees</li>
                    <li><a href=""> Medical expenses</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="">Non-economic damages</a> are not as easy to value, but should be considered, nonethe less. These damags include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss consortium</li>
                    <li>Diminished quality of life</li>
                    <li>Diminished quality of life</li>
                    <li><a href="">Physical pain and suffering</a></li>
                    <li>Reputational damage</li>
                    <li><a href="">Disfigurement and scarring</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href=""> Punitive damages</a> might also apply to your case in extreme cases, but only if the trucker’s behavior or the actions of the trucking company were particularly egregious. Reckless and drunk driving are common examples.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="pagesRightColumnCar">
                    <p>Most large truck crashes in Los Angeles happen because of negligence. This means that another driver or some other party acted unreasonably or failed to act and caused you else harm.</p>
                    <h1>Evidence & Documentation after a Truck Accident</h1>
                    <p>While proving a truck driver or their employer’s negligence caused a collision sounds easy, especially if you believe they were speeding, distracted, or tired, the reality is much different.</p>
                    <p>Common examples of evidence in a truck accident claim are black box data from the truck itself, police and medical reports, truck deconstructionist data, and corporate documents.</p>
                    <p>The burden of proof is based on a preponderance of the evidence – you need enough evidence to demonstrate that the other party is more than likely responsible for your injuries. This includes photos, medical records, and other documentation.</p>
                   
                    <h1>Proving Truck Accident Liability & Fault</h1>
                    <p>Someone must be held financially responsible for your injuries. Your injuries alone aren’t enough. This is usually the driver or their employer. This is referred to as the ‘liabile party.’ Liability is determined by establishing the four elements of negligence. This essentially means that someone owed you a duty of care, they breached that duty and therefore caused your injuries that resulted in the need for monetary compensation.</p>
                    <p>Los Angeles is an at-fault state for liability in a car accident. In most cases, you will file a third-party claim with the responsible driver’s insurance company or their employer if they were working at the time.</p>
                    <p>However, insurance companies are reluctant to give you what you’re owed. It’s vital to retain a truck accident lawyer to represent you.</p>

                    <h1>Trucking Industry Regulations</h1>
                    <p>The trucking industry has an array of state and federal laws in place for the safety of truckers and other drivers. At Benji PI, we stay up to date on all of them and how they play a role in your case.</p>
                    <h1>California & Federal Truck Safety Rules</h1>
                    <p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the California Department of Transportation have a number of regulations in place to protect truck drivers and others on the road.</p>
