                <h1>Injured in an Uber or Lyft Accident? Our Attorneys Can Help.</h1>
                <p>Ridesharing has become extremely popular in the past few years. Apps such as Uber and Lyft can assist you in getting a ride to any destination with just a few clicks on your smartphone. As a result, if a driver is ever involved in a crash that injures passengers or pedestrians, receiving compensation could pose a difficult challenge for those involved.</p>
                <p>With the help of an experienced Los Angeles Uber accident lawyer, you can file a claim and may be able to recover compensation in an Uber accident settlement for your damages and losses from the rideshare accident. Call Benji's Accident Injury Lawyers, P.C. today at (312) 248-6195 to find out more. We offer free initial consultations and work on a contingency fee basis.</p>
                <h1> Rideshare Insurance Policies in Los Angeles in California?</h1>
                <p>Both Uber and Lyft’s insurance policies are complex and complicated. Drivers are covered by their own car insurance during the times when they are not available to pick up passengers.</p>
                <p>When they are on duty, they carry their own car insurance plus liability coverage from Uber or Lyft. When the drivers do have passengers in their cars, they are covered by a $1 million liability policy and an additional $1 million uninsured motorist policy. That’s much more than the minimum required amount in most states.</p>
                <p>While this may seem like you’d be covered in an accident, it’s worth noting that Uber and Lyft drivers are considered independent contractors. An independent contractor means that the drivers are not technically employees of these companies, and as such, Uber and Lyft may deny responsibility for accidents that are caused by the drivers. Because of this, receiving the compensation you deserve can be difficult without the help of an experienced Uber accident lawyer.</p>
                <p>Things can get complicated quickly when you are an Uber car accident passenger or if you were hit by an Uber driver. That’s why if you are injured in a car accident caused by an Uber or Lyft driver, you need to seek legal help immediately. A Los Angeles Uber accident lawyer at Staver Accident Injury Lawyers, P.C. can evaluate your case and determine how much you can expect to receive for your damages.</p>
                <p>Call today at (312) 248-6195 to schedule a free and confidential case assessment with one of our experienced Los Angeles Uber accident attorneys.</p>

                <h1>Causes of Uber & Lyft Accidents in Los Angeles</h1>
                <p>There are many different ways that Uber and Lyft drivers can cause serious car accidents. While some of the most common causes include speeding and distracted driving, Uber car accidents can also be caused by the following:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Speeding: Speed limits are meant to regulate the roads and help ensure all motorists’ safety. However, rideshare drivers are often in a hurry to pick up and drop off passengers so they can move on to the next one and make more money. This can result in a dangerous accident. </li>
                    <li>Fatigue: Many rideshare drivers work for Uber or Lyft as a part-time job after already working an eight-hour day elsewhere. Because of this, the Uber or Lyft drivers are more likely to be tired while driving passengers. This can easily result in a car accident due to fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Distracted driving: With passengers in the car, it’s easy to get distracted by conversing and not focus on the road. In addition, the driver may take their eyes off the road to check their Facebook status, send a quick text, respond to an email, eat, and even more. If a driver takes their eyes off of the road for even a split second, they will not be able to react on time to a traffic signal or other motorist, and a severe accident could occur.</li>
                    <li>Reckless driving: Examples of reckless driving include if your Uber driver fails to yield, runs a red light or a stop sign, or fails to adhere to any other traffic law. If you notice your rideshare driver driving recklessly, you should contact an attorney immediately if there’s an accident. You could be eligible to collect compensation through an Uber accident settlement.</li>
                    <li>Aggressive driving: Your rideshare driver might drive aggressively and thus, in a dangerous manner to get you to your destination faster in order to leave to pick up another passenger. If your Uber driver tailgates other cars, makes abrupt lane changes, or accelerates quickly, then causes an accident, contact an attorney right away to file an aggressive driving claim.</li>
                    <li>Failure to maintain the vehicle: Rideshare drivers are not employees, which means that Uber and Lyft are not responsible for the mechanical condition of their independent contractors’ vehicles. Worn tires and brakes, as well as engine issues and poor general maintenance, can make their cars break down and could cause harm to the passengers.</li>
                    <li>Work zones: Since construction is common in Los Angeles, your Uber driver could easily overlook lowered speed limits and other work zone signals. As a result, an Uber accident could occur. </li>
                    <li>Road Hazzards: Hazards on the roadway can lead to a car accident. Such hazards can include: potholes, improper drainage systems, uneven pavement, and an absence of road or traffic signs. In addition, inclement weather can pose a threat to your safety in an Uber and could potentially lead to a car accident./li>
                </ul>
                <p>if you believe your Uber accident was caused by your rideshare driver, you should contact an experienced Chicago Uber accident attorney at Staver Accident Injury Lawyers, P.C. right away. We can help you file your claim and pursue compensation for your damages.</p>

                <h1>Rideshare Crashes in Los Angeles</h1>
                <p>If an Uber driver causes an accident, it can cause injuries to either a passenger or bystander, meaning a pedestrian or person in another vehicle. If you are a passenger injured during a rideshare, you should be covered under the $1 million policy.</p>
                <p>If the Uber driver hits you while you are a pedestrian or are in another vehicle, Uber would be liable if the driver was currently working and/or taking a passenger on a trip. The $1 million coverage policy applies in this situation.</p>
                <p>In the event that the Uber driver who hit you was off duty, their personal insurance plan would come into play. Contingent liability coverage may apply here as well.</p>
                
                <h1>What if my Uber Driver Crashes While I’m a Passenger?</h1>
                <p>If you are in a crash while a passenger in your Uber and do not sustain any injuries, you may not think you need legal advice. However, you could be asked to give your recount of what happened. An experienced Uber accident attorney can help you if you’re called for a statement.</p>
                <p>If you are an injured Uber accident as a car passenger because of the Uber driver or another reckless driver, you are covered up to $1 million. In order to receive more than $1 million as a settlement, you would have to file a claim against the negligent driver or company. We can help if you have a rideshare claim.</p>
                <h1>What if an Uber Driver Hit My Car?</h1>
                <p>If you were injured while riding in an Uber due to your Uber driver’s recklessness, you can file a lawsuit and could be eligible for compensation. Uber has liability coverage of $1 million that will cover their drivers if they are on their way to pick up a passenger or in the middle of the passenger’s Uber ride. But, Uber states they are not responsible for their drivers outside of these limits and that they are considered independent contractors. You may have to file a claim with the driver’s personal insurance to receive additional compensation as well.</p>
                <p>Uber’s insurance policy consists of the following:</p>
                <h2>Third Party Liability Coverage</h2>
                <p>This liability coverage covers up to $1 million in property damage, pedestrian injury, and any other third party damages or injuries caused.</p>
                <h2>Uninsured or underinsured motorist bodily injury coverage</h2>
                <p>This policy covers up to $1 million in bodily injuries because of an accident due to an uninsured or underinsured driver’s negligence. This also applies to hit and run cases.</p>
                <h2>Contingent collision and comprehensive coverage</h2>
                <p>This coverage will cover your vehicle if you have collision coverage. This type of coverage covers up to how much your car is worth.</p>
                <h1>Lyft’s Insurance Policy and Lawsuits</h1>
                <p>Lyft also has insurance coverage of up to $1 million for Lyft driver car accidents. Like Uber, your Lyft ride is covered from the time that you request your ride until you are dropped off. During this time, Lyft’s insurance policy covers the following:</p>
                <h2>Contingent Liability</h2>
                <p>This is applicable only when you are waiting for your ride. Lyft’s contingent liability can cover up to $50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident. and up to $25,000 for property damage. This policy is applicable when the driver’s “driver mode” is on.</p>
                <h2>Primary Automobile Liability</h2>
                <p>This is covered up to $1 million.</p>
                <h2>Contingent Comprehensive and Collision</h2>
                <p>This policy provides coverage to damages to your car in an accident or non-collision events such as a fire, inclement weather, etc. There is a $2,500 deductible, and you are eligible for this policy as long as you have comprehensive and collision coverage on your personal policy. In addition, this coverage will match either how much your car is worth or the cost of reparation.</p>
                <h2>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist</h2>
                <p>If your Lyft driver is in an accident because of an uninsured or underinsured motorist, then Lyft’s $1 million policy will come into play.</p>
                <h1>Contact a Los Angles Rideshare Accident Lawyer</h1>
                <p>Car accidents can have long-term consequences. If your driver causes an accident, you could be dealing with the injuries and consequences for a long time.
